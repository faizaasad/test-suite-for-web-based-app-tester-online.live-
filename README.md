**Project Overview**
The backend system is built with Node.js, and this test suite validates core backend features, including API endpoints, database interactions, and authentication mechanisms.

**Purpose**
The backend test cases focus on validating:
Core API endpoints
Database interactions
Authentication and authorization mechanisms
Data processing and business logic
**Technology Stack**
Node.js v14.x
MongoDB
Mocha & Chai as testing frameworks
**Prerequisites**
To set up and run this project, ensure you have the following installed:
Node.js (version 14.x or above)
npm (Node Package Manager)
MongoDB
**Installation**
Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/faizaasad/test-suite-for-web-based-app-tester-online.live-.git
cd tester-online-live
Install Project Dependencies
Install the required Node.js dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
npm install
**Environment Setup**
Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and configure the following environment variables:
bash
Copy code
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/tester_online_live
PORT=3000
JWT_SECRET=mysecurejwtsecret
DATABASE_URL: Use mongodb://localhost:27017/tester_online_live if you're running MongoDB locally.
PORT: Specify the port your application will run on (default is 3000).
JWT_SECRET: Set a secure key for JSON Web Token (JWT) signing.
Seed the Database

**Running the Server**
Add the Start Script
Open the package.json file and ensure the following script is added under "scripts":

json
Copy code
"scripts": {
  "start": "node server.js",
  "test": "mocha"
}
Start the Server
To start the server, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the backend server on port 3000 (or the port specified in your .env file). Ensure that the server is running before proceeding to run the test cases.

**Running Test Cases**
Test cases for the backend are located in the testcases folder. These tests are written using Mocha and Chai.

Run Mocha Test Cases
To run all the test cases, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm run test
This will execute all the test cases and display the results in the console.

**Manual API Testing**
To manually validate the API endpoints, you can use Postman. Follow these steps to connect Postman to your server:

Start the Server
Ensure the server is running by executing:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Open Postman
Open Postman and create a new request:

Select the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) based on the API endpoint you're testing.
Enter the API URL, typically http://localhost:3000/[your-endpoint].
Example:

bash
Copy code
POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/register
Send the Request

Provide necessary headers (e.g., Content-Type: application/json).

Add the request body in JSON format, if required. For example:

json
Copy code
{
  "username": "testuser",
  "password": "password123",
  "email": "adminlogin@example.com"
}
Click Send and review the response from the server.

Validate Responses
In Postman, check:

Status Code: Ensure it matches the expected result (e.g., 200 OK, 400 Bad Request).
Response Body: Verify the correctness of returned data.
Error Handling: Test invalid inputs to ensure proper error responses are returned.
**Test Data Management**
Test data is managed through factory functions or database seeding. You can modify or create test data within the test case files if required.

Example of test data setup in a test case:

javascript
Copy code
beforeEach(() => {
  // Seed database with test data before each test
  seedDatabaseWithTestData();
});
