Project Overview
The backend system is built with Node.js, and the following test cases validate core backend features, including API endpoints, database interactions, and authentication mechanisms.

Purpose
The backend test cases focus on validating:

Core API endpoints
Database interactions
Authentication and authorization mechanisms
Data processing and business logic
Technologies
Node.js (v14.x or above)
MongoDB 
Mocha & Chai (for testing)
Prerequisites
To set up and run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (version 14.x 
npm (Node Package Manager)
MongoDB version
Installation Steps
1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/faizaasad/test-suite-for-web-based-app-tester-online.live-.git
cd tester-online-live
2. Install Project Dependencies
Install the required Node.js dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and configure the following environment variables:

bash
Copy code
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/tester_online_live
PORT=3000
JWT_SECRET=mysecurejwtsecret
DATABASE_URL: Use mongodb://localhost:27017/tester_online_live if you're running MongoDB locally. Adjust it for any cloud-based MongoDB service (like MongoDB Atlas) following their connection string format.
PORT: Specify the port your application will run on (default is 3000).
JWT_SECRET: Set a secure key for JSON Web Token signing (e.g., mysecurejwtsecret).
4. Seed the Database (if required)
If your project requires database seeding, provide instructions here on how to seed the database.

Running the Node.js Server
1. Add the Start Script
To start the server using npm, open the package.json file and ensure the following script is added under "scripts":

json
Copy code
"scripts": {
  "start": "node server.js",
  "test": "mocha" // Make sure the test script is defined
}
2. Start the Server
To start the server, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the backend server on port 3000 (or the port specified in your .env file). Ensure that the server is running before proceeding to the next steps.

Running Test Cases
Test cases for the backend are located in the testcases folder. These tests are written using Mocha and Chai.

1. Run Mocha Test Cases
To run all the test cases located in the testcases folder, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm run test
This command will execute all the test cases and display the results in the console.

Validating Functionality with Postman
To manually validate the API endpoints, you can use Postman. Follow these steps to connect Postman to your server:

1. Start the Server
Ensure the server is running by executing:

bash
Copy code
npm start
2. Open Postman
Open Postman and create a new request.
Select the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) based on the API endpoint you're testing.
Enter the API URL, which will typically be http://localhost:3000/[your-endpoint].
Example: If you're testing a user registration endpoint, it might look like this:

bash
Copy code
POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/register
Provide the necessary headers (e.g., Content-Type: application/json).
If required, add the request body in JSON format. For example:
json
Copy code
{
  "username": "testuser",
  "password": "password123",
  "email": "testuser@example.com"
}
Click Send and review the response from the server.
3. Validate Responses
Check the following in Postman to validate the functionality:

Status Code: Ensure the status code matches the expected result (e.g., 200 OK, 400 Bad Request).
Response Body: Verify that the response body contains the correct data.
Error Handling: Test invalid inputs to ensure error responses are returned correctly.
Test Data Management
Test data is managed through factory functions or database seeding. You can modify or create test data within the test case files if required.

Example of test data setup in a test case:

javascript
Copy code
beforeEach(() => {
  // Seed database with test data before each test
  seedDatabaseWithTestData();
});
